 You are required to complete the tasks for any one of the datasets for understanding on how graphs help in investigating hidden patterns in the data
 
# Tasks
First Set of Tasks – Graph Stats
1. Display the number of nodes 
2. Display the number of edges 
3. Display the number of source nodes 
4. Display the number of sink nodes 
5. Display the number of isolated nodes 
6. Display the number of bridge edges 
7. Display the number of articulation nodes 
8. Display the shortest path length distribution 
9. Display the diameter of the graph 
Second Set of Tasks – Degree Distributions
10. Display the in-degree distribution in the form of a table 
11. Display the out-degree distribution in the form of a table 
Third Set of Tasks – Connected Components
For the original graph:
12. Display the size of the largest strongly connected component (SCC) 
13. Display the size distribution of all SCCs (
Considering the graph as an undirected graph:
14. Display the size of the largest weakly connected component (WCC) 
15. Display the size distribution of all WCCs
