# Description

You are required to complete the tasks for any one of the datasets for understanding on how graphs help in investigating hidden patterns in the data
 
# Tasks
First Set of Tasks – Graph Stats <br />
1. Display the number of nodes <br />
2. Display the number of edges <br />
3. Display the number of source nodes <br /> 
4. Display the number of sink nodes <br />
5. Display the number of isolated nodes <br />
6. Display the number of bridge edges <br />
7. Display the number of articulation nodes <br />
8. Display the shortest path length distribution <br />
9. Display the diameter of the graph <br />
<br />
Second Set of Tasks – Degree Distributions <br />
<br />
10. Display the in-degree distribution in the form of a table <br /> 
11. Display the out-degree distribution in the form of a table <br />
<br />
Third Set of Tasks – Connected Components <br />
<br />
For the original graph: <br />
<br />
12. Display the size of the largest strongly connected component (SCC) <br /> 
13. Display the size distribution of all SCCs <br />
<br />
Considering the graph as an undirected graph: <br />
<br />
